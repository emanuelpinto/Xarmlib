# Xarmlib - (It will) work like a charm!
Experimental C++ library for bare-metal ARM Cortex-M platforms

## Warning:
***This library is mainly a personal project. For now, it is nothing more than a testbed for experiments and tests. It is in a very immature and early state of development and contains most certainly lots of bugs and issues that need to be fixed. You can use it freely in any way you like but it comes with absolutely no warranty at all! - You have been warned! :-)***

***Alone we don't go far...*** This library uses some code and ideas taken from other persons and projects:  

- The startup code is *heavily* based on the [Cortex-M Startup](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/cortexm-startup-DEPRECATED) project, part of the [ÂµOS++ IIIe](https://github.com/micro-os-plus) project. <-- *Great project, check it out!* Copyright (c) 2016 [Liviu Ionescu](https://github.com/ilg-ul).
- The low level peripheral drivers for the LPC84x family of MCUs are based on the [LPC845 Example Code Bundle MCUXpresso](https://www.nxp.com/downloads/en/software/LPC845-Example-Code-Bundle-MCUXpresso.zip) supplied by NXP. All rights reserved. (c) 2017 NXP B.V.
